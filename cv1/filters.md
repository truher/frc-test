# Filters

Our goal is to illuminate the target with a narrow spectrum, and to filter out everything else from the camera.  The monochromatic LED illuminator
spectrum is pretty narrow, about 40nm, see the [emitters](emitters.md) doc for details.  Here's a typical emitter spectrum:

Ideally we'd like a filter that matches that narrow band, called a "bandpass" filter, like this.  The scales are a little different,
but you can still see how the LED peak from 500 to 550 nm just fits nicely inside the passband spanning the same range.

For blue, we could use a "shortpass" filter, since there's not much background below blue anyway:

Similarly, for red, we could use a "longpass" filter:

So what specific filters are available?

# Available options

There are many possibilities for filtering blue, green, or red illumination, and they vary enormously in cost.  There are two main types:

1. The least expensive color filter is a [theater gel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_gel).  These work using dyes to __absorb__
the unwanted spectrum; they're intended to filter broad-spectrum illuminators into narrower bands, but they also work just as well
on the detector end.  Most gels are not particularly precise in spectrum terms, and many of them don't transmit very well in the passband.
2. The most precise filter is a "dichroic" (Greek meaning "two color") filter. These work using layers of thin films to __reflect__
the unwanted spectrum (thus the name, they split one "color" from the other).  These are much more expensive than gels.
