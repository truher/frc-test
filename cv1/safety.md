#Safety

Radiation is dangerous.  Long-wave radiation (e.g. radio waves)
[can be bad](https://www.fcc.gov/engineering-technology/electromagnetic-compatibility-division/radio-frequency-safety/faq/rf-safety):
they heat parts of the body not accustomed to being heated.  Short-wave radiation (e.g. x-rays) are
[definitely bad](https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.1096).  When you're building a bright strobe light,
you need to think about the effects of the bright light on the people around the device.

There are TK standard concerns with lighting, according to the [ICNIRP guidelines](https://www.icnirp.org/cms/upload/publications/ICNIRPbroadband.pdf)
